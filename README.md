## Description
TBD

## Methodology
The analysis uses supervised learning, employing three classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. 

The methodology includes:
* **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
* **Model Training**: The models are trained on the dataset, which is split into training and test sets.
* **Model Evaluation**: The models are evaluated using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix is also used to assess model performance.
* **Feature Importance**: The models rank features based on their contribution to the survival prediction.

## Required Dependencies
To run the project, the following Python libraries are required:
* `pandas`
* `numpy`
* `scikit-learn`
* `matplotlib`
* `seaborn`
TBD

## Output
The script generates:
* **Feature Importance Plots**: Visualizations showing the most influential factors in predicting survival (e.g., age, gender, fare).
* **Confusion Matrix**: For each model, visualizing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
* **Model Performance Metrics**: Including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for each model.

## Limitations
TBD

## Future Improvements
